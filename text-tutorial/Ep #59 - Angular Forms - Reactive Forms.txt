Ep #59 - Angular Forms - Reactive Forms

1. Inroductions

    - Reactive forms are a way to create forms in Angular Application
    
    - What's different is how we implement, design and handle the form and handle the form and the data 
    
    - All the form elements, user intercations and validations are handled in the component class 
    
    - We will make use of Angular's built in formGroup and formControl 
    
    - Using a Reactive form we can control better data binding 
    
    - Exclusive define custom regular expression patterns of error handeling 
    
    - We will need to import ReactiveFormsModule in our app module 
    
    - Very flexible and allows users to define, develop complex requirements of forms 
    
    - More logic in the component class and less in HTML mark up itself 


2. Angular maintains the state information of forms at all times 

    - ng-touched 
    
    - ng-untouched 
    
    - ng-dirty 
    
    - ng-pristine 
    
    - ng-valid 
    
    - ng-invalid 

3. Misconception 

    - It's tough 

    - Very complex 

    - difficult to learn and implement 

    - only for complex application 

    - adding custom validations are tricky in Reactive forms
